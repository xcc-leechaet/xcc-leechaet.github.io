<p>Hello, I am xushasha.</p>
<p>I am now studying for my master's degree in BME in School of Physics at Peking University </p>
<p>I am looking for research assistant job opportunities in the field of medical image processing</p>
<p> I am interested in multimodal medical image registration and segmentation </p>
<p>please contact me via my email: xcczbl@stu.pku.edu.cn or wechat: ic9832419xcc</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Radiation therapy is usually divided or “fractionated” over a treatment course lasting multiple weeks.
  Fractionation in the context of radiotherapy is the process of dividing a dose of radiation into multiple “fractions”.
  During this period, the cancerous region or the target area may gradually shrink.Thus we should adjust our radiation therapy plan to protect
  normal tissue away from radiation exposure and focus on the cancerous area.To realize it, we need to register two images in different period.
  through image ,registration ,we will have a clear knowledge about how the organ or the target area deforms.</p>

<p>Below is the optimization of the projects I have completed</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Multimodal rigid registration based on point cloud</a> </li>
  
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Faster and more robust method to realize coarse rigid registration</a> </li>

  <li> <a href="test.txt">CT bedremove algorithm based on hough transform</a> </li>
  
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Optimization of numerical solution computation of control point mesh gradient for free-form model based on B-splines</a> </li>
