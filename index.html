<p>Hello, I am xushasha. </p>
<p>I am now studying for my master's degree in BME in School of Physics at Peking University </p>
<p>I am looking for research assistant job opportunities in the field of medical image processing</p>
<p>please contact me via my email:xcczbl@stu.pku.edu.cn or wechat:ic9832419xcc</p>

<p> I am interested in multimodal medical image registration and segmentation </p>
<p>Below is the optimization of the projects I have completed</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Faster and more robust method to realize coarse rigid registration</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Optimization of numerical solution computation of control point mesh gradient for free-form model based on B-splines</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Improved diffeomorphic demons algorithm</a> </li>
  <li> <a href="test.txt">Improved CT bedremove algorithm based on hough transform</a> </li>
</ul>
