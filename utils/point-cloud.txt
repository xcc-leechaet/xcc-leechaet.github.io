Although the grayscale distribution of different modal images is different, there is a certain rigid structure - bones.
By setting the threshold range, the bone point clouds of CT and MRI images can be extracted.
Performing ICP registration on point clouds can achieve rigid registration of three-dimensional multi-modal images.
In this process, we adopt point cloud downsampling to achieve coarse registration.
